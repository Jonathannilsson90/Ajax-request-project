# Ajax-request-project

## Project assignment about how to consume API's and apply information into our own website, through AJAX-request(s).
---
In this solo project I decided to use an API that handles food, more specific dishes and how to cook them.

This site takes in one ajax-request in order to find dishes that could intrest you in any form of cooking, will it be desserts or sides, whatever your tastebuds decides.
